# Contribution Guide
Our goal is to build an open, inclusive and collaborative open source community. Everyone is welcome to participate.

## Report Bugs
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on Github under [jeandle-jdk-issues](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-jdk/issues) and/or [jeandle-llvm-issues](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-llvm/issues). If you cannot find an open issue addressing the problem, feel free to create a new one.

## Propose Improvements or New Features
Submit your proposal on [jeandle-jdk-issues](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-jdk/issues) or [jeandle-llvm-issues](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-llvm/issues). Ensure your proposal includes sufficient details to clearly convey your idea.

If you plan to implement your proposal to contribute to the community, please follow the [Contribute Code](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-jdk/blob/main/jeandle-docs/contribution-guide.md#contribute-code) section.

## Contribute Code
Welcome all kinds of code contributions including bug fixes, new features or improvements to existing code (e.g., performance, accessibility, readability, etc).

Not sure where to start? Browse [jeandle-jdk-issues](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-jdk/issues) and [jeandle-llvm-issues](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-llvm/issues), where you may find interesting topics to work on. For new contributors, it's a good idea to start with issues labeled as "good first issue".

To get started with Jeandle, see [Getting Started](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-jdk/blob/main/jeandle-docs/getting-started.md).

### 1. Make code changes
Before starting, indicate your interest in working on a specific issue by commenting on it or creating a new one. It is best to have a full discussion with community members before working on a challenging or large-scale issue.

Commit your code with ```git commit -s```, which adds a “Signed-off-by” line to commit messages indicating that you have signed the [developer certificate](https://developercertificate.org/).

For code contributors, also see [Development Guide](https://github.com/jeandle/jeandle-jdk/blob/main/jeandle-docs/development-guide.md).

### 2. Create a pull request
Fork jeandle-jdk and/or jeandle-llvm, push commits to your forked repository, and create a pull request to the upstream repository. The title of a pull request must begin with one of the following labels to indicate the type of the pull request: fix, feat, docs, style, refactor, enhance, test, build, ci, chore, or revert.

### 3. Get a code review
Jeandle Maintainers will regularly check for unreviewed pull requests. If a pull request has received more than one approval from Maintainers and all "Request Changes" from Committers/Maintainers are resolved, it can be merged by any Maintainer.

If your pull request has not received a response for days, you can find potential reviewers from [Maintainers list](https://github.com/jeandle/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) and get their attention by tagging them using @name in a comment.

## How to Become a Committer/Maintainer
